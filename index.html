                <p>In the UK, we are lucky to have a fully-functioning modern sewage system which means we often 
                    do not give much thought about what happens to the sewage and wastewater produced each day. Due to
                     population growth, accelerated urbanisation and economic development – in addition to an increase in 
                     rainwater, the demand for our systems has increased dramatically. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What is a Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO)? 
                    <br>
                    According to the Environment Agency, England has a combined sewage 
                    system which is made up of 100's of thousands of kilometers of sewers. This dates back to Victorian times. 
                    This means that rainwater and wastewater are conveyed in the same pipe. In times of heavy rainfall - which we 
                    get a lot of in the UK - the capacity of these pipes can be, and often is, exceeded. This puts pressure on the 
                    system that means potential inundation of sewage works with the possibility of a back-up flooding people's homes,
                    roads etc. Unless it is allowed to spill elsewhere. CSO's were created as overflow valves which reduce the pressure 
                    on the system and reducing the risk of these flooding events.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As mentioned above, these systems are meant to be used as an EMERGENCY only to be used in EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. 
                    And yet, as evidenced in our data visualisations above, we know that there are thousands of discharges every year, and 
                    the problem only seems to be getting worse. </p>

                    The picturesque coastal areas of Cornwall, known for their astounding beauty, face a growing environmental
                     crisis. The rising tide of sea pollution, primarily due to sewage dumping, is threatening marine life, water
                      quality, and the health of local residents. In 2021, the areas of Falmouth and Fowey reported an alarming 1065
                       and 1922 sewage spills, respectively. The longest spill in Fowey lasted a distressing 4.49 days.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The surge in sea pollution, mainly attributable to the region's outdated sewage infrastructure constructed in
                     the 1800s and 1900s, is further aggravated by the system's misuse, such as inappropriate disposal of wet wipes,
                      fats, and grease, causing blockages and overflows. This antiquated system is inadequately prepared to manage
                       the demands imposed by a growing population, urbanisation, and climate change, resulting in frequent spills
                       of untreated sewage into coastal waters. Concurrently, sea pollution is intensified by other factors including 
                       acid rain, a consequence of air pollution, which taints marine habitats and endangers aquatic life. Additionally, 
                       runoff from agricultural fertilisers enhances nutrient levels in the water, triggering harmful algal blooms, a process
                        referred to as eutrophication. These blooms upset the ecosystem balance, reducing oxygen levels, potentially generating 
                        toxins, and consequently influencing the food chain and all marine life.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    The repercussions of this ongoing environmental catastrophe are growing more evident. The discharge of untreated sewage injects 
                    hazardous quantities of nitrogen and phosphorous into the water, triggering a loss in biodiversity and ecosystem disruptions. Excessive 
                    nutrients provoke algal blooms that obstruct sunlight, asphyxiate marine life, and may even generate toxins threatening the broader ecosystem 
                    and human health. Alarmingly, in 2020, sewage was discharged into UK waters more than 400,000 times, with wastewater overflow enduring for 
                    over 3.1 million hours, highlighting the gravity of this issue. The predicament is further amplified by the government's provision to allow sewage 
                    discharge at any moment, should there be a shortage of treatment chemicals due to supply chain complications.

                    Researchers point towards urban planning rather than replacing sewage 
                    infrastructure as the most effective and efficient solution to sewage
                    overflows. Examples of these include rain gardens and permeable pavements,
                    designed to manage the runoff in a sustainable way by replicating the 
                    drainage processes provided by the natural environment. It is mandatory 
                    in Wales for new developments to incorporate sustainable drainage systems
                    (SuDS), but England has yet to follow. When it comes to existing developments 
                    there is no current legislation which makes it more of a challenge.

                    sewage management’.
