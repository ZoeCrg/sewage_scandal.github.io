              <h4 class="introduction"> In an extensive investigation into Cornwall's environmental challenges, our team meticulously
                 studied the region's most polluted beaches, with a particular focus on three highly popular and widely frequented 
                 destinations. Seaton Beach, Trevone Beach, and Porthcurno Beach have long been cherished by beachgoers and hold 
                 immense significance in terms of recreational activities and environmental awareness.

              <p> Trevone Bay, positioned in the northern coast of Cornwall, is a surfing hotspot for both intermediate and experienced enthusiasts.
                 Notably, it endured a significant 372 hours of sewage dumping throughout 2021, amounting to approximately two weeks with one event
                  accounting for almost 100 hours . Despite this, the Environment Agency has bestowed upon it excellent water quality ratings for 2019,
                   2021, and 2022. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In south eastern Cornwall near Looe, Seaton Beach is a notable family-oriented site. It, too, faced substantial sewage dumping in 2021, 
                with a total of 1054 hours, including a singular 264 hour incident. Yet, it upholds an excellent rating from the Environment Agency for 
                water quality. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Porthcurno Beach, a part of Cornwall's far west, had 383 hours of sewage dumping in 2021, with one event accounting for almost 240 hours. 
                 Still, this location maintains its top water quality ratings from the Environment Agency. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                These three beaches hold the doubtful distinction of being the worst in Cornwall in terms of sewage dumping hours for 2021. Nevertheless, according to the
                Environment Agency they still provide excellent water quality for their visitors. It's worth noting that the major sewage dumping incidents largely
                 occur outside the peak bathing season, minimising the potential impact on the regular visitors of these picturesque settings.

                 Further in-depth data about the individual incidents and the impact can be found in the accompanying information pop-ups on the interactive map. 
                 This additional content will provide deeper context, including year-on-year comparisons, detailed event timelines, and further exploration of the areas. 
                 All data for this analysis was sourced directly from the Environment Agency.
