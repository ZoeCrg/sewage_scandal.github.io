              <h4 class="introduction"> In an extensive investigation into Cornwall's environmental challenges, our team meticulously studied the region's most 
                polluted beaches, with a particular focus on three highly popular and widely frequented destinations. Seaton Beach, Trevone Beach, and Porthcurno
                Beach have long been cherished by beachgoers and hold immense significance in terms of recreational activities and environmental awareness

              <p> Further in-depth data about the individual incidents and the impact can be found in the accompanying information pop-ups on the interactive
                map. This additional content will provide deeper context, including year-on-year comparisons, detailed event timelines, and further exploration
                of the areas. All data for this analysis was sourced directly from the Environment Agency.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Trevone Bay, positioned on the northern coast of Cornwall, is a surfing hotspot for both intermediate and experienced enthusiasts. Notably, it 
                endured a significant 372 hours of sewage dumping throughout 2021, amounting to approximately two weeks with one event accounting for almost 100 
                hours. Despite this, the Environment Agency has awarded the location with excellent bathing water quality ratings for 2019, 2021, and 2022.  
                <br>
                <br>
                In South East Cornwall, near Looe, Seaton Beach is a notable family-oriented site. It, too, faced substantial sewage dumping in 2021, with a total 
                of 1054 hours, including a singular 264-hour incident. Yet, it upholds an excellent rating from the Environment Agency for bathing water quality.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Porthcurno Beach, located in far west Cornwall, experienced 383 hours of sewage dumping in 2021, with one event accounting for almost 240 hours. 
                Still, this location maintains its top water quality ratings from the Environment Agency.  
                <br>
                <br>
                It's important to elaborate on what bathing water quality entails, as elucidated by Gabriella Garland Environment Planning Specialist at Environment 
                Agency during our interview. It serves as only a “guideline” designed to keep the public informed about the safety levels for swimming in a particular 
                body of water. The Environment Agency underscores this concept on their website. They persistently advise swimmers to remain alert for indications of
                sewage spills, particularly after rainfall, irrespective of the designated water quality classification.
                <br>
                <br>
                These three beaches hold the doubtful distinction of being the worst in Cornwall in terms of sewage dumping hours for 2021. Nevertheless, according
                to the Environment Agency, they still provide excellent bathing water quality for their visitors. It's worth noting that the major sewage dumping 
                incidents due to storm overflows largely occur outside of the peak bathing season, This could potentially endanger the health of those frequenting 
                the beach, especially surfers, who take to the waves outside the regular bathing season. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, the better news is “the new piece of policy of the environment act, states that there's an ownership now to ensure that storm overflows are 
                protected all year round”, said Gabriella Garland.
