              <h4 class="introduction"> In our investigation into Cornwall's bathing water, we studied its most polluted beaches, with a focus
                  on three popular destinations: Seaton beach, Trevone bay beach, and Porthcurno beach. All three have ‘excellent’ bathing water 
                  and all three suffered hundreds of hours of sewage dumping, according to the most recent data.

              <p> Further in-depth data about the individual incidents and the impact can be found in the accompanying information pop-ups on the interactive
                map. This additional content will provide deeper context, including year-on-year comparisons, detailed event timelines, and further exploration
                of the areas. All data for this analysis was sourced directly from the Environment Agency.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Trevone bay beach, on the northern coast of Cornwall, is a surfing hotspot that endured a 372 hours of sewage dumping throughout 2021. One hundred
                hours of this dumping took place over four days in April. Despite this, the environment agency has awarded the location a rating of “excellent” for
                its bathing water quality in 2019, 2021, and 2022 (Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data for the year 2020 was not recorded).
                <br>
                <br>
                Seaton beach is a popular location in south-east Cornwall, near Looe which suffered over one thousand hours of sewage dumping in 2021. One single
                incident lasted 264 hours. And it too holds an “excellent” rating from the environment agency for bathing water quality.
                <br>
                <br>
                Porthcurno beach, in west Cornwall, experienced 383 hours of sewage dumping the same year, with one event accounting for almost 240 hours. Still, 
                this bathing water also maintains its top-quality rating.
                <br>
                <br>
                These three beaches hold the doubtful distinction of being among the worst in Cornwall in terms of sewage dumping hours for 2021. However according
                to the Environment Agency, they still provide excellent bathing water quality for their visitors.
                <br>
                <br>
                The major incidents of sewage dumping, which are often linked to heavy storms causing sewage overflow, mainly occur outside the peak bathing season.
                Which runs from May to September, while the testing takes place during the bathing season.
                <br>
                <br>
                We investigated why the Environment Agency does not conduct a year-round monitoring of the bathing water. Gabriella Garland, a planning specialist at 
                the agency, responded that following the "bathing water regulation" limits their testing season. She also mentioned the difficulty they face in 
                expanding the monitoring due to funding issues, stating "funding for us in the environment agencies is always a problem". She added that changing the
                regulation and securing additional funding are decisions to be made by the government. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, there is some promising news as Gabriella Garland added “The new piece of policy of the environment act which will be coming out soon, ensures
                that storm overflows are protected and monitored all year round even outside of the bathing season”.
