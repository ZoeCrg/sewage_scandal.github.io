              <p class="introduction">Researchers point towards urban planning rather than replacing sewage infrastructure as 
                the solution to sewage overflows. With population growth, new builds and the impacts of climate change causing
                 increased rainfall, existing infrastructure is struggling to keep up. Many pipe systems were constructed in the
                  Victorian era and can’t handle the demands of today, leading to sewage overflows and contaminated waterways.
                   Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) are designed to be used only in emergencies, but there are thousands of
                    discharges, and this number is increasing every year, indicating that the problem is only getting worse.
              </p>
              <p>Experts propose installing special rain gardens and permeable pavements can reduce the amount of rainwater
                 that runs into drains and ends up in the sewerage system, as these systems collect rain water and allow it 
                 to soak into the ground. These methods are known as sustainable drainage systems and there are more initiatives
                  available as cities look for innovative solutions to manage their water systems.

                108 rain gardens were installed in Cardiff as part of the Greener Grangetown project, a delivery partnership 
                of Cardiff Council, Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water and Natural Resources Wales. Chris Ellis, who works as a Water 
                Engineer at Arup and managed the design of the project, believes this kind of sustainable drainage could be
                a big part of the solution to an ageing sewerage system. In an email, he said it’s “an effective water 
                management solution for reducing the rate and volume of water entering existing systems”. Since the project
                was implemented in 2018, it has proven to be a great success, removing more than 40,000m³ of rainwater each 
                year from entering the CSO network.

                However, some residents have complained that the rain gardens are muddy and unsightly. Chris explains that 
                design considerations are crucial when building these systems, as one of the challenges can be maintaining the
                gardens on a regular basis.

                New developments in Wales have been legally obliged to install SuDS since 2019, but this law does not extend 
                to England. There is currently no law to encourage better management of rainwater for existing urban areas. 
                Amina Aboobakar, Commercial Director of environmental charity The Rivers Trust, believes there are several barriers 
                preventing the uptake of nature-based solutions, suggesting in an interview that “because nature-based solutions are 
                so diverse, it is very difficult to nail a standardised approach”.

                Surfers Against Sewage has been campaigning for over 30 years to protect the ocean from sewage pollution. 
                The group supports the implementation of sustainable drainage systems as a solution to manage runoff, pushing for the UK government to make 
                this mandatory for new developments in England. Surfers Against Sewage are hosting a National Day of Action on Saturday 
                20th May 2023, as part of the Paddle Out Protest, encouraging all to stand together against sewage pollution and demand
                 water companies to invest in greener solution</p>
