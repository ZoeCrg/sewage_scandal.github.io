## The Project: 
We are a student led group interested in unveilling the truth surrounding the ongoing sewage scandal. As part of our Masters degree,
we have come together, combining all of the skills we have learnt throughout the year, to complete a project on a topic of our choice.
Our project topic is one that we feel particularly passionate about, with one of our group members being from Cornwall herself.

This project aims to highlight some of the shocking realities of sewage pollution and the quality of our bathing waters, in addition to 
shining a spotlight on some of the fantastic projects and campaigns that are turning the tide on the sewage scandal.
