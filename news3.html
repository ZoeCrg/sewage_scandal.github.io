              <p class="introduction">  
                Residents in South-East Cornwall say the government’s claim of high-quality beaches does not match their experience after
                 over 290,000 hours of sewage dumping in 2022, as beaches are only monitored half of the year. Bathers in Cornwall are
                 frequently urged not to swim in the sea after rainfall overwhelms combined sewage overflow (CSO) pipes. 

              </p>
              <p>
                In 2022, 100% of the designated bathing waters in Devon and Cornwall passed the water quality standards, supposedly providing 
                beachgoers with lots of locations to bathe safely. Yet, locations such as Seaton Beach in South-East Cornwall, which received 
                an ‘excellent’ classification received 216 sewage alerts, equating to a shocking 1,054 hours of sewage discharge into the river 
                and sea (for the year 2021). With spills lasting up to 20 days, it’s no surprise that beaches across Cornwall are frequently 
                declared as unsuitable for swimmers.
                <br>
                <br>
                Neither the Environment Agency nor DEFRA appear to hold any information on the number of beach closures, or the number of times 
                the public has been advised not to swim in the water, due to sewage pollution. 

                <br>
                <br>
                Local wild swimming enthusiasts, such as Teresa Newman have expressed frustrations with the frequent sewage discharges, stating
                “I wish I could be more confident in the water quality and think it is wrong that water companies can still discharge sewage 
                into the sea via sewage overflows. We should feel safe swimming from any beach in Cornwall.” Tamsin Gates, who swims throughout 
                the year in Cornwall, said via Facebook “I am absolutely furious about the pollution of our rivers and beaches. We pay really high 
                water rates, and it rains a lot here and for what? ... Our reservoirs are empty, we have an ongoing hosepipe ban so can't water our
                gardens properly, and there is SEWAGE discharged into our rivers and the sea.”

                Cornwall has been officially in a drought since last August, with no mention of when this may cease, due to the depleted levels
                 of reservoir waters and lower levels of rainfall. Despite this, sewage discharge has continued to flow, seemingly because of the 
                 short, sharp bursts of rainfall which overwhelm the CSO pipes. Cornwall is notoriously one of the wettest counties in England, 
                 experiencing almost double the national average of rain according to the Met Office. For locals such as Tamsin Gates, these excuses 
                 and the lack of investment just isn’t good enough.

                 <br>
                 The Environment Agency annually measure levels of pollution in designated bathing waters during the period 15th May to 30th 
                 September, to determine whether a bathing spot is ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘sufficient’, or ‘poor’. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, only 89 locations in Cornwall are designated bathing waters, although Cornwall Council boasts over 300 beaches. None of 
                these designated waters are rivers.
                <br>
                <br>
                The ‘regular’ testing conducted by the Environment Agency is up to 20 tests conducted within the 20-week summer bathing period. 
                Resources are evidently stretched thin, and local agency workers have told us they feel frustrated at an imperfect sampling system.
                 With much of the rainfall occurring outside of the official bathing season, many who enjoy using the waters year-round find the 
                 frequent sewage dumping off-putting, with some even falling ill because of it.

                 Alex Thom is a swimmer and ex-surfer in South East Cornwall, who is now more cautious about his beaches. “I got out of the habit of 
                 going bodyboarding very regularly due to several ear infections that the GP said were most likely due to sewage in the water”, he said. 
                 “The recent tv documentaries and other media attention have made us consider where and when we swim far more carefully”.

                 Another local swimmer, Sarah Spry said over messages that she and her family have been made sick on the beaches. “We have had times when we have been ill, and we believe it has been down to sewage in the sea. At these times a wide variety of family and friends have shared symptoms who have been in the sea, but we have struggled to find the source, or any further information so it has made us nervous to swim for a while”.

                 <br>
                 Sarah is among many locals who have said they use apps such as the Surfers Against Sewage ‘Safer Seas & Rivers Service’ to keep themselves informed and safe in the water. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 As we head into the 2023 bathing water season, it appears the system is far from perfect, and whilst groups such as Surfers Against Sewage and The Rivers Trust work tirelessly to provide the public with real-time accurate data and information to enable safer informed choices regarding bathing waters, there is much more that needs to be done to protect our waters and the public’s health. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 If you are venturing to the beach or a dip in the rivers this bathing season, be sure to check out the resources from Surfers Against Sewage and The Rivers Trust, keep an eye out for signs of sewage pollution, and check signs at designated bathing water sites issued by the Environment Agency or local Council for more information.

                Data for 2022 has, up until recently, been unavailable due to a recent investigation into illegal sewage dumping conducted by 
                South West Water. For this reason, this article features data from the most recent available dataset. At the time of writing, 
                this was 2021. Any data regarding 2022 was accessed via Top Of The Poops.
